The dataset includes a boolean field called “Arrest”, where each record indicates whether an arrest was made for that specific incident at the time the report entered the system. A value of True means the police made an arrest connected to that event. A value of False means no arrest was recorded at that point, which could be because the suspect wasn’t identified, the case was still under investigation, or the incident did not lead to an arrest for other reasons.\n",

It highlights the gap between the total number of incidents and the subset that result in immediate enforcement action, offering insight into policing outcomes and the complexity of criminal investigations.
